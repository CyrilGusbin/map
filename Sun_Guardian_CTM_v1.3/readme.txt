=== Description ===

Sun Guardian CTM is a massive survival islands adventure map with loads of datapack magic.  

Enter a strange land filled with crazy loot and even crazier enemies that defy vanilla behavior. 

Bring light back to a dark world by employing custom swords, magic scrolls, and even mechanical crossbows.
Features

    12 Distinct Areas/Dungeons
    8 Scripted Boss Fights
    Interactive World: Two-way dialogue NPCs, towns, shops, and lore
    Mechanical Crossbows: Unique weapons distinct from vanilla bows/crossbows featuring a reload system
    Magical Scrolls: Summon fireballs, lightning, and more
    Strange Enemies: Zombies might shoot arrows, skeletons throw tridents - cheeky skeletons snipe you from across the map
    Secrets Galore: Loads of optional areas, quests, and hidden treasures

Still not sure if the map is your cup of tea?  Totally understandable! 

Starting a new CTM map is a major time investment, that's why this map features a good deal of the custom content in the tutorial area.


=== For Multiplayer ===

When starting a multiplayer run, try to get everyone in before starting the map
Remember to enable command block functionality in your server.properties file (or equivalent if running on papermc, spigot, etc)
